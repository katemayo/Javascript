# EACH HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT

### Do a `git pull upstream master` on the JS DC 7 repo


### Do your homework in the `homework` folder, typically in a file or folder called `starter`


### When finished, save your work


### `git add` and `git commit` your work


### `git push` on your master branch to push the code to your forked repo


### Go to github.com and submit a Pull Request from the master branch of your forked repo against the master branch of the original JS DC 7 repo
- Please name the PR with *the name of the class folder of the lesson the homework was assigned in*, with the word 'homework' at the end. For example, today's homework is part of the `02-data_and_operators` lesson, so you would name your PR `02-data_and_operators homework`.
