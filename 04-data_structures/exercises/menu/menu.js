// ARRAYS //
////////////


// Create an array called "breakfast" to hold the user's favorite breakfast foods

// Ask them what their favorite breakfast food is and add it to the array

// Ask them 2 more times so there are a total of 3 breakfast foods in the array (hint: could you make this shorter with a loop?)

// Print out the user's favorite breakfast foods along with their rank; i.e. ("Eggs is your #1 favorite breakfast food!")

// Create a new variable that is an alphabetically sorted list of the user's favorite breakfast foods
// then print them again (just print the entire array, don't print them individually)


// Change the user's favorite breakfast food to 'Avocado', and then print their new favorite food list
// then print them again (just print the entire array, don't print them individually)

// Remove the user's second favorite item from the array entirely
// then print them again (just print the entire array, don't print them individually)


// Write a loop that asks the user to add 3 more foods to the array


// Create a new variable that is a list of only foods that have the letter 'e' in them
// then print them again (just print the entire array, don't print them individually)



/////////////
// OBJECTS //
/////////////

// Create a variable that holds an empty object literal, call it "menu"

// Using dot notation, create a key "breakfast" on the menu object, and assign it to our "breakfast" array from above

// Create keys for "lunch" and "dinner" on the menu as well, and set these equal to arrays that you have pre-filled with foods
// (you don't need to ask the user for these foods, just write them in yourself)

// Ask the user which meal they'd like to see a menu for: breakfast, lunch, or dinner?
// Then print out the appropriate menu


// Loop over each meal in our menu and print out the contents of the array, along with the name of the meal
// i.e. "Here is our breakfast menu: ['eggs', 'bacon', 'cereal']"


// Remove the "lunch" menu from our object
