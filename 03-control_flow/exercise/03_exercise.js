/*
  While Loops
  In-class Exercise #2
  Code Independently, then together

// Create a variable called `dice` and initialize it to null


// Create another variable called `numRolls` and initialize it to 0


// Write a while loop that executes ONLY if the value of the dice is NOT 2


// If the while loop executes, console.log the value of the dice


// Set the die to a new random number (hint: check out Math.random)


// Once the while loop is done executing, console.log "I lost :("


// QUESTION: Can we make this better with a do... while loop?
